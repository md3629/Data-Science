# Customer Segmentation using R
Discussing process and experimenting with clustering -extending Power BI with R

<h3>Building a customer segmentation inÂ R</h3>
<p> A simple customer segmentation in R using Power BI as UI. </p>
Using KMeans for Segmenting Customers and determining the Optimal value of K using Elbow Method. <br>
First part is checking data quality and Visualising the Dataset using various dimensions.
<br>
The Second part is choosing the number of clusters - this is a very easy dataset.  
<br>
From the second visualisation, we observe that there is a distribution of 6 clusters as follows<br>
<br>
Cluster 1: This Cluster represents the customers who have a low Annual Income as well as a low Annual spend.<br>
Cluster 2: This Cluster represents the customers who have a high Annual Income but spends low.<br>
Cluster 3 + 4: This Cluster represents the customers having a medium Annual Income as well as a medium Annual spend, with two age groups, up to 40 and above.<br>
Cluster 5: This Cluster represents the customers having a low Annual Income but spends way too much.<br>
Cluster 6: This Cluster represents the customers having a very high Annual Income along with a high spending.
