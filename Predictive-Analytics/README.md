# Predictive Analytics

## Predictive sales analytics
**Predictive sales analytics** involves using historical sales data and other relevant information to forecast future sales. Here's a step-by-step implementation of predictive sales analytics in R:

**Data Collection**: Gather historical sales data, including variables such as date, product ID, quantity sold, price, and any other relevant features that may influence sales (e.g., promotions, marketing campaigns, economic indicators).

**Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues. Convert categorical variables into appropriate formats, and ensure that the data is ready for analysis.

**Feature Engineering**: Extract or create additional features that may improve the predictive accuracy of the model. This could include lagged variables, seasonality indicators, and derived features based on domain knowledge.

**Split Data**: Split the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the predictive model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

**Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate predictive model for sales forecasting. Common models include linear regression, time series models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA), machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting), and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM neural networks).

**Model Training**: Train the selected model using the training data. Tune hyperparameters as necessary to optimize performance.

**Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using the testing data. Use metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to assess its accuracy.

**Prediction**: Use the trained model to make sales predictions for future time periods. Visualize the predicted sales values and compare them to the actual sales values to assess the model's performance.

**Iterate and Refine**: Iterate on the model, refining features, tuning parameters, and experimenting with different algorithms to improve predictive accuracy.
