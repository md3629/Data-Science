## Predictive Analytics under uncertainity using Monte Carlo simulation

Discussing process and experimenting with Monte Carlo

<h3></h3>
<p> The first part is a simple Service costing in R using Power BI. <br>
The Second part is Cost Volume Profit (CVP) Analysis.  
<br>
The next part is Financial budgeting under uncertainity<br>
The last part is the application of Real options and a simple example to illustrates the power of real options through the execution of an option to wait. <br>

Problem: Given a set of state variables and associated net cash flows for an investment project simulated through Monte Carlo simulation, solve for the real option value of a capital investment project through the least-squares Monte Carlo simulation (LSM) method.	<br>
