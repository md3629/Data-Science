Overview
This repository is designed to showcase a variety of analytical techniques and models used in data science, particularly within the domains of finance, customer behavior, and operations. The models are built using R, and the projects are structured to provide clear examples of how to apply these models in practical scenarios.

Projects
#### 1. Financial Analytics
  Predictive Analytics under Uncertainty: Utilize Monte Carlo simulation to predict outcomes under uncertain conditions.

  Real Options: Analyze the value of flexibility in investment decisions.

Marketing Mix Modelling: Understand the impact of different marketing channels on sales and optimize spending.

Forecasting: Build models to forecast future trends based on historical data.

Lagged Predictors: Use lagged variables in predictive models to capture delayed effects.

#### 2. Customer Analytics
Predictive Sales Analytics: Analyze sales data to predict future sales performance.
Customer Profitability Analytics: Evaluate the profitability of different customer segments.
Value Driver Analytics: Identify key drivers of customer value.
Customer Segmentation (Clustering): Group customers based on similar characteristics for targeted marketing.
Customer Churn Prediction: Predict which customers are likely to leave using classification models.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Estimate the total value a customer brings over their lifetime.
#### 3. Operational Analytics
Supply Chain Management: Optimize supply chain operations using predictive analytics and other modeling techniques.
### How to Use
