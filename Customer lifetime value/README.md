# Customer lifetime value
Customer lifetime value (CLV) analytics involves predicting the total value a customer will bring to a business over the entire duration of their relationship with that business. R language offers various libraries and tools to perform CLV analytics. 

**Load Required Libraries**: Load the libraries into our R session.

**Data Preparation**: Prepare our customer data. We need historical data on customer transactions, such as purchase amounts, dates, and customer identifiers.

**Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM) Metrics**: RFM analysis is a common technique used in CLV analytics. It segments customers based on their recency of purchase, frequency of purchase, and monetary value of purchases. Calculate these metrics for each customer.

**Fit Probability Models**: Use survival analysis techniques to estimate the probability that a customer will remain active (not churn) over time. This can be done using packages like survival.

**Predict CLV**: Once we have the RFM metrics and survival probabilities, we can use them to predict the CLV for each customer. There are various methods for doing this, such as the Gamma-Gamma model for predicting monetary value and the Pareto/NBD model for predicting future transactions.

**Visualize Results**: Visualize the CLV predictions and other relevant metrics using plots and charts to gain insights and communicate findings effectively.
