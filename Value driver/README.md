# Value driver analytics
**Value driver analytics** refers to the process of identifying and analyzing the key factors or "drivers" that contribute to the creation of value within an organization. 

These drivers are typically the underlying variables or metrics that have a significant impact on the organization's performance, profitability, and success. 

In R, there are several models and techniques commonly used for value driver analytics, which aim to identify and quantify the key drivers of business value. Some of these models include:

**Linear Regression**: This is one of the most commonly used statistical techniques for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (e.g., business value) and one or more independent variables (e.g., key drivers such as revenue, expenses, customer satisfaction, etc.).

**Multiple Regression Analysis**: Extending linear regression to multiple independent variables, multiple regression analysis allows for the exploration of complex relationships between business value and multiple potential drivers.

**Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)**: GLMs are a flexible class of models that can accommodate various types of response variables and distributions, making them suitable for analyzing business value drivers in different contexts.

**Decision Trees**: Decision tree algorithms, such as CART (Classification and Regression Trees) or random forests, can be used to identify and visualize important value drivers in a hierarchical and interpretable manner.

**Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)**: GBMs are powerful machine learning algorithms that can effectively capture nonlinear relationships between business value and its drivers, making them suitable for complex value driver analytics tasks.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used to identify latent variables or patterns in high-dimensional datasets, helping to uncover the most important value drivers.

**Factor Analysis**: Similar to PCA, factor analysis can be used to identify underlying factors or dimensions that explain the variation in business value and its drivers.

**Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)**: SEM is a comprehensive statistical framework for modeling complex relationships between observed and latent variables, allowing for the simultaneous estimation of multiple causal pathways and feedback loops.

# Business case: using PCA for value driver analytics:

## 1. Data Preparation
Prepare your dataset by selecting relevant variables that you believe are potential value drivers. Ensure that the data is cleaned and in the appropriate format for analysis.

## 2. Standardize the Data
Standardize the variables to ensure that they are on the same scale. This step is crucial for PCA because it is sensitive to the scale of the variables.

## 3. Perform PCA
Perform PCA on the standardized data to identify the principal components. We can use the prcomp() function in R for this purpose.

## 4. Explore Principal Components
Explore the principal components to understand how much variance each component explains and which variables contribute most to each component.

## 5. Interpret Results
Interpret the results of PCA to identify the underlying patterns or structures in the data. Look for groups of variables that load heavily on the same principal component, as these may represent common underlying factors or value drivers.

## 6. Analyze Component Loadings
Analyze the component loadings to identify the variables that contribute most to each principal component. Variables with higher loadings on a component are more strongly associated with that component and may be considered important value drivers.

## 7. Select Key Components or Drivers
Select the key principal components or variables that represent the most important value drivers for your analysis. You can use criteria such as the proportion of variance explained or the magnitude of component loadings to guide your selection.

## 8. Conduct Further Analysis
Once you have identified the key components or drivers using PCA, you can conduct further analysis to understand their impact on performance, profitability, or other relevant outcomes. This may include regression analysis, cluster analysis, or other statistical techniques to explore relationships and make data-driven decisions.

By using PCA for value driver analytics, you can effectively reduce the dimensionality of your dataset, identify important underlying factors or drivers, and gain insights into the factors that contribute most to the value creation in your organization.
