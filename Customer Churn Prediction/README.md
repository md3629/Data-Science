# Customer Churn Prediction with Survival Analysis in R

**Customer churn prediction** using survival analysis in R involves modeling the time until customers churn (i.e., stop using a service or product) using survival analysis techniques. Here's a basic guide on how to perform customer churn prediction using survival analysis in R:

## 1. Data Preparation
Prepare your customer data, including features such as customer characteristics, usage behavior, and churn indicator (whether a customer churned or not). Ensure that you have a timestamp for each customer's entry into the dataset and either their churn timestamp or a censoring indicator if they're still active.

## 2. Loading Required Libraries
Load the necessary libraries for survival analysis in R. Commonly used libraries include survival, survminer, and dplyr.
